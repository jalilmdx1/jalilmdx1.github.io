# _Hi..._

I am Jalil, a psychology undergrad with aspirations of being an organizational consultant turned cinematographer. A strange turn of events has led me to a path which I couldn't be happier with. I was recently on a shoot in Shenzhen, China, a place where the summer is no joke. And the thing is, even after hours of filming, with the heat and humidity clinging to my soul, my clothes drenched in sweat, and the weight of the camera tiring my arms, I asked myself, would I prefer to be sitting in a nice office working on a computer right now? The answer was no, so that's why I do what I do.

Now that you know more about me, I want to know a bit about you. Tell me about your project and how I can help you by e-mailing me [HERE](mailto:{{ site.email }}){:target="_blank"}.

And if you didn't get enough of me yet, check out my Instagram [@jalilbutron](http://www.instagram.com/{{ site.instagram_username }}){:target="_blank"} <br>:)
